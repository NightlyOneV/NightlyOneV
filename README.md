<p align="left">Greetings, wanderer of the repos. I'm José Roberto, a Systems and Game Developer always chasing better ways to build and understand interactive worlds.<br>I’ve been working with LuaU and Roblox for 3+ years, mostly focused on game systems, mechanics, and data handling. Games were my first contact with programming and, honestly, they still fuel my curiosity every day.<br>I like crafting experiences from the ground up, experimenting with mechanics, and exploring how tech shapes gameplay. If I’m not building something, I’m probably studying how to build it better.<br><br>Right now, I'm studying Systems Development at SENAI and diving deep into new tech and concepts to grow beyond game systems and become a more complete developer, not only on Roblox but outside it as well.<br><br>My goal is to create my own stories and games, but that doesn’t mean I won’t grow in other areas too. I want to build worlds, systems, and skills that can take me as far as my curiosity goes.</p>
